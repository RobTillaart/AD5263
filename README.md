# AD5263

Arduino library for I2C digital potentiometer AD5263 and compatibles.


## Description

The AD5263 is a digital potentiometer with 4 channels.
This digital potentiometers come in 20, 50 and 200 kâ„¦
and can be set in 256 steps.

An important property of the devices is that they defaults
to their mid position at startup.

The library also defines **AD5263_MIDPOINT** == 128.
To be used to set to defined mid-point.

(Library is based on datasheet Rev.F )


#### Related

This library is related to

- https://github.com/RobTillaart/AD524X single/dual port digital potentiometer.
- https://github.com/RobTillaart/AD5245 single port digital potentiometer.
- https://github.com/RobTillaart/AD520X multi port digital potentiometer.

#### Compatibles

The AD5280 and AD5282 are one and two channel devices that might be compatible.
Not tested yet. See future.


## I2C address

The AD5263 has two address lines to configure the I2C address. 0x2C - 0x2F

|  Addr(dec) |  Addr(Hex)  |  AD0  |  AD1  |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    44      |    0x2C     |  GND  |  GND  |
|    45      |    0x2D     |  GND  |  +5V  |
|    46      |    0x2E     |  +5V  |  GND  |
|    47      |    0x2F     |  +5V  |  +5V  |

Note the AD5263 uses the same range as the AD524X devices.


## Interface

```cpp
#include "AD5263.h"
```

The library has a number of functions which are all quite straightforward.
One can get / set the value of (both) the potentiometer(s), and the O1 and O2 output lines.


#### Constructors

- **AD5263(uint8_t address, TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** constructor,
creates an instance with 4 potentiometer.
- **bool begin()** if connected **begin()** resets the device,
otherwise returns false.
- **bool isConnected()** See if address set in constructor is on the bus.


#### Basic IO

- **uint8_t write(uint8_t rdac, uint8_t value)** set channel rdac 0..3 to value 0..255.
- **uint8_t write(uint8_t rdac, uint8_t value, uint8_t O1, uint8_t O2)** idem + set output lines O1 and O2 too.
- **uint8_t read(uint8_t rdac)** read back set value.
rdac should be 0..3.
- **uint8_t setO1(uint8_t value = HIGH)**  value = HIGH (default) or LOW.
- **uint8_t setO2(uint8_t value = HIGH)**  value = HIGH (default) or LOW.
- **uint8_t getO1()** read back O1 line.
- **uint8_t getO2()** read back O2 line.


#### Misc

- **uint8_t zeroAll()** sets potentiometer's to 0 and I/O to LOW.
- **uint8_t reset()** sets potentiometer's to midpoint == 127 and I/O to LOW. (startup default)
- **uint8_t midScaleReset(uint8_t rdac)** resets one potentiometer to midpoint == 127.
- **uint8_t readBackRegister()** read register back, for debugging.


#### Experimental

- **uint8_t shutDown()** check datasheet, not tested, use at own risk.


## Error codes

|  define        |  value  |
|:---------------|:-------:|
|  AD5263_OK     |   0     |
|  AD5263_ERROR  |   100   |


## Future

#### Must

- update documentation.
- test with hardware


#### Should


#### Could

- investigate AD5280/82 compatibility.
- improve error handling.
- sync with AD520X / AD524X library
- optimize footprint **write()** and **midScaleReset()**


#### Wont
